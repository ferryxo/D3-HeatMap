The calculations are correct, 0.5844g of NaCl with 50.00mL water added will give us 0.2M of solution. When we take 5.00mL of that solution and dilute it ten times (with the 50.00mL flask), we will get 0.02M NaCl solution. If we repeat this two more times, the solution will be diluted 0 more times, giving us our desired concentration of 2*^-4 M.
